# ExpressioHostSelectionModel
A machine learning model based on the protein features of different protein expression hosts can evaluate the feature adaptability of the target protein to the expression hosts, and thus identify the appropriate expression hosts for the target protein.

## Dependencies:
  |     Name      | version            |
  | ------------- | ------------------ |
  | R             | 4.4.2 or higher    |
  | tidyverse     | 2.0.0 or higher    |
  | tidymodels    | 1.2.0 or higher    |


## data genereation 

1. the data was generated by using follwoing tools according to the operational guideline’s manuals：
         Peptides (version 0.3.2, https://pypi.org/project/peptides/) 
         Propy3 (version 1.1.1, https://pypi.org/project/propy3/)

2. The features used for model prediction need to be generated in the order of the feature names listed in "feature names and order for model.xlsx", and obtaining the data for yourprotein.
   

## How to use this tool:


1. Download files: download all BTXO.RData.part1.rar to BTXO.RData.part7.rar, and unzip them in the same folder. You can obtain the ".RData" file.

2. Open it in Rstudio.

3. Enter the following code：
   
'''r
load(".RData")
  
library(tidyverse)
  
library(tidymodels)
  
yourprotein <- read.csv("yourfile.csv",header = F,col.names = name)#Import your data; better without column name, if your data have the right names, please set "header = T".
    
expression_host_for_proteins <- data.frame(name=yourprotein$yourproteinname, #the name of your protein, if you have.
   
                                preclass=predict(final_fit, new_data = testR),#Give the candidate host name for your protein.
   
                                preprob=predict(TdataSW.roF1,unknownS,type = 'prob' ))#Give the probabilities that your protein adapting to different hosts.
                                  
write.csv( expression_host_for_proteins,' expression_host_for_proteins.csv')\
'''   

     (Note: Please adjust the above codes to suit your needs.)
